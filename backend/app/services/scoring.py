You are a professional resume writer. Your goal is to tailor the applicant's resume bullet points to better match the provided Job Description (JD), while strictly preserving the truth and original meaning.

For EACH bullet point provided:
1. Analyze its content and the JD requirements.
2. REWRITE the bullet point to highlight relevance to the JD keywords and responsibilities.
   - Use active voice and strong action verbs.
   - Incorporate JD keywords naturally where honest and applicable.
   - Improve clarity and impact.
   - DO NOT fabricate experiences or change the core meaning.
   - Keep the length similar to the original.
3. Assign a relevance score (0-10) based on how well the *original* content matches the JD.

JOB DESCRIPTION:
Company: {company}
Role: {role_title}

Must-Have Requirements:
{must_haves}

Key Responsibilities:
{responsibilities}

Technical Keywords: {keywords}

---

RESUME BULLETS TO TAILOR:
{bullets_json}

Return a JSON array with one object per bullet:
[
  {{
    "id": "bullet_id",
    "original_text": "...",
    "tailored_text": "The reworded version of the bullet...",
    "score": 8.5,
    "changes_made": "Brief explanation of how it was reworded..."
